# Game Description
### Story
```markdown
Once upon a time, there was a mystical land where light and shadow danced, and colors met each other. This land was known as the "Mirror Land". However, due to an ancient curse, the beauties of this land began to fade. Light cannot find the right paths and shadows are everywhere. Brave adventurers came together to put an end to these dark forces. 

Main Story:
The game positions players as heroes who set out to illuminate this lost land. Each of them aims to progress through this dark maze using the power of light and the magic of mirrors. Players must solve complex puzzles using various mirrors and light beams and overcome obstacles that become more difficult at each level.

Characters and Roles:

Lumen: Master of Light. Lumen, the main character of the game, is an expert in directing and reflecting light. With his guidance, players develop new strategies for each level.

Mirroria: Queen of Mirrors. Throughout the game, Mirroria teaches players how to place mirrors in the best way and supports them by using her special powers.

Shadow: Master of Shadows. Shadow, the secret enemy of the game, presents new challenges at each level and tries to hinder the progress of the players.

# Sprints
Sprints will be 2 weeks long. At the end of each sprint, a sprint review will be held to evaluate the work done during the sprint and a refirement meeting will be held for the next sprint. Task scoring in sprints will be done with Fibonacci numbers (from 1 to 8).

Story Points:
- 1 - Very Easy
- 2 - Easy
- 3 - Medium
- 5 - Hard
- 8 - Very Hard

When estimating the time for each task, care should be taken to make these times realistic. Tasks are determined before the sprint starts and worked on these tasks during the sprint. New tasks created while the sprint is in progress should be opened in the backlog. If the developers finish their tasks, new task assignments are made from the backlog.
